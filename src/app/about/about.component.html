            SMEs contribute substantiallyto the global economic growth, 
            but legacy systems pave thorny roads for such entities through 
            unequitable barriers and regulatory norms. Similarly, the traditional 
            Trade & Logistics domain is not conducive to alternative investors, 
            especially those indulging in crypto.

            Antelope DAO embarks on a mission to disrupt this scenario, striving to 
            establish a decentralized, trustless, and automated ecosystem for traders 
            and financiers across magnitudes. To this end, the foundation has developed 
            the Antelope protocol, benefitting a geographically distributed usersâ€™ 
            community and envisioning a future with harmonious connectivity, collaboration, 
            and seamless integration between stakeholders of the global Trade & Logistics sector.
