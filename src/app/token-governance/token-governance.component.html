            Devoted to the principles of decentralization, 
            the Antelope ecosystem adopts a hierarchical, two-tier, 
            and skill-based governance infrastructure comprising a 
            Technical Council and a Business Council
        </p>
        <p>
            The mechanism explores Conviction or Quadratic Voting 
            systems to effectively mitigate sybil attacks, 
            collusion, and other risk vectors that are typical 
            of time-boxed governance procedures.

                    The TC votes on matters concerning protocol 
                    upgrades, inflation adjustments, and 
                    commission parameters. Initially appointed 
                    by the Antelope DAO, subsequent applications 
                    for council membership will be subject to 
                    a two-third consensus of the ANTLP community
